# Introduction
This outline has been created to assist you in writing your project assignment. You should cite all the sources you use, articles, presentations, projects, etc. Quoting and referencing gives readers the opportunity to access the resources you refer. **Even though you use your own words, if you are conveying the ideas of others in your work, you have to document the source of these ideas. Otherwise, you are committing academic plagiarism.** For example, you can refer to @aydinonat:2007 for academic writing rules. You can find lots of online resources on this topic.

The sections in your project assignment must necessarily include the sections in this text (except the first section, of course). Apart from the sections used here, you can use different subsections. When writing your project, use this file as a draft and adapt its content to your purposes.

In this section, mention the purpose and importance of your work in a few paragraphs.
 
 Question: Is playing Premier League matches at home more advantageous?
  
 
 The purpose of my project is to investigate whether playing Premier League matches at home provides a significant advantage for the home team compared to playing away. The home field advantage has been studied in sports for over a century, and it is widely acknowledged that playing at home provides teams with an advantage over their opponents.

Therefore, I will review and analyze several articles that have addressed the home field advantage in sports, as well as articles specifically focused on the Premier League. By doing so, I manage to provide a comprehensive and evidence-based assessment of the extent to which playing Premier League matches at home is advantageous for the home team.



## Literature Review

In this section, discuss the articles you have read on the subject by giving references. This is a narrative citation @chang:2013. This one is a parenthetical citation [@chang:2013]. **Do not summarize each article individually under a separate title.** In the literature review section, **at least four** articles must be cited [@newbold:2003; @verzani:2014; @wickham:2014; @wooldridge:2015a].



**References section is created automatically by Rmarkdown. There is no need to change the references section in the draft file.**

**_You shouldn't delete the last 3 lines. Those lines are required for References section._**



 The articles does not directly refer to the home advantage or the difference that playing a match at home or away could make. However, the Poisson models used in the article are structured to predict the outcomes of matches by taking into account the probabilities of the home and away teams scoring goals. Therefore, the results of the models take into consideration the performances of the home and away teams separately. The home field advantage has been studied for over a century, and there is general consensus that it exists and gives the home team an advantage of around 55-60% over their opponents. Four factors contribute to this advantage: crowd involvement, travel fatigue, familiarity of facilities, and referee bias. Soccer has one of the highest home field advantages among major sports, and the advantage tends to deteriorate as athletes play longer on an away field. The article also discusses how home field advantage can vary based on the number of games per season, the strength of the teams, and the rules of the sport.
